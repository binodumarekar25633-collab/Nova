   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` = your OpenAI key (secure)
   - `CM_EMAIL` = your email (optional for notifications)
4. Start the **flutter-android** workflow. Codemagic will:

   - Add required Android permissions,
   - Build a **release APK**.

## Local testing
If you want to test locally, you can hardcode your API key in `lib/codegen_screen.dart`
by replacing:
```dart
const String openAIApiKey = String.fromEnvironment('OPENAI_API_KEY');
```
with:
```dart
const String openAIApiKey = "sk-...";
```

> Note: Internet + Microphone permissions are added automatically in Codemagic. If you run locally, ensure they exist in `AndroidManifest.xml`.
